description: 'So I make chili. I think it’s pretty good chili too. My good friend Bryan, from the great state of Texas thinks it’s the best Chili he’s had (Don’t tell his family). What’s my secret? Think like a cowboy. Think like cooky, from city slickers, or just think like John Wayne. Whoever you decide to conjure up in your head, just make sure they can think on their feet, because that’s the basis we’ll be working from.'

So I make chili. I think it's pretty good chili too. My good friend Bryan, from the great state of Texas thinks it's the best Chili he's had (Don't tell his family). What's my secret? Think like a cowboy. Think like cooky, from city slickers, or just think like John Wayne. Whoever you decide to conjure up in your head, just make sure they can think on their feet, because that's the basis we'll be working from.

I got my Chili making method from my mom and aunt bear I think. It all started from the way I learned to make Curry- using over ripened bananas as a thickener, coffee for that earthy taste, but that's another recipe.

On with it, already!
